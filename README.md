# AIMSS Google Colab Workshop 2020
Hi everyone! Welcome to the AI in Medicine Student Society's first ever workshop. This repository stores the data we are going to be using and the steps to set up the Colab notebook.

## First steps
We need somewhere to keep the data and the code:
* Visit https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive
* Create folder `aimss_colab_workshop`

## Download Data

Go to this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AIMSS-UAlberta/colab_workshop_2020/main/breast_cancer_dataset.csv

* Use CTRL+S to save to your local machine
* Once saved, upload to `aimss_colab_workshop` in your Google Drive

## Prepare Notebook

In order to edit the demo notebook, you must save your own copy on your drive.
* Visit https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ebHw2hR-ACxXJiIg-UMMcOjvCFDFbJji?usp=sharing
* Follow `File > Save a Copy In Drive`
* *OPTIONAL*: On your copy, follow `File > Locate in Drive`.  Move notebook to `aimss_colab_workshop`. (If this is not done, it will be in a new folder in your Drive called `Colab Notebooks`)
